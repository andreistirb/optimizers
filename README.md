# Gradient Descent Optimizers
The algorithm runs a classic linear regression that outputs a*x + b in the forward pass. 


It stops when both parameters reach a 0.001 difference between learned weights and true weights.

# Results

Below we show results: number of epochs until it reaches stopping condition described above
